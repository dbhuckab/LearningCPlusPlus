Suppose that you want to write an application for a company that matches
employers and job seekers. A first step would be to design appropriate classes.
Look at Figure 2.6 as a starting point. In this diagram, the Person has two
subobjects: Employer and Position .

To do this exercise, you need to use forward class declarations ( Section 2.10 ).
a. Write classes for Person , Position , and Employer , as described in Figure 2.6 .
b. For Person::getPosition() and getEmployer() , create and return something
funny if the person has not yet been hired by a company.
c. For the hire(...) function, set the Person ’s state so that future calls to
getPosition() and getEmployer() give the correct result.
d. In the main() program, create at least two Employers: the “StarFleet Federation”
and the “Borg.”
e. Create at least two employees: Jean-Luc Picard and Wesley Crusher.
f. For each class, write a toString() function that gives you a string representation
of the object.
g. Write a main program that creates some objects and then prints out each
company’s list of employees.
